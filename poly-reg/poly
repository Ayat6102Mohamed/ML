Apply Polynomial regression from scratch to reduce the mean square error acquired on the updated student performance dataset “assignment2dataset.csv” attached with lab 4
Your code should be dynamic (allow degree=2, degree=3 and so on).
Built-in Polynomial Transformation is NOT ALLOWED
You can use linear regression built in for the regression model but not Polynomial features transformation built in
You should handle the preprocessing of the “Extracurricular Activities” column
You should apply feature selection (you must choose 2 or more features) and use 
     a train-test split (80% train-20% test)

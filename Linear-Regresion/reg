Apply simple linear regression to predict the performance index of a student.  
❖ Find the best variable (X) that can be used to predict the performance index (Y).  
❖ This variable (X) can be provided by the dataset as is (for example: use Sleep Hours as 
“X” to predict price “Y”) or it can be a calculated variable (for example: use a new 
variable Hours Studied+Questions Practices as “X” to predict performance index “Y”). 
❖ Your code must show at least all four basic trials (for the four columns).  
❖ Use simple linear regression from scratch as discussed in Lab 2 and try adjusting the 
learning rate and number of epochs as needed.
